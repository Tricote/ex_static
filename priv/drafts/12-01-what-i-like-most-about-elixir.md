How hard is it to switch to Elixir web development when you comes from Rails/Django/Laravel
Not that hard IMHO

* Of course you need to learn the Elixir basic syntax
* Somehow grasp the functional programming. It helps if you comes from a multi-paradigm language like Ruby or Javascript because you already use some functional pattern like list manipulations, higher order functions (`map`, `reduce`, ...)
  - but it's actually pretty smooth. You'll discover that colocating data and behaviour in Objects

What i enjoy the most in the day to day work on an Elixir Web Application

* Elixir
  - Pattern Matching
  - Working on lists
  - All pure function, never ask yourself if a function changes your input or not !
* Ecto
  - Changesets
  - Super powerful query builder with a syntax very close to the SQL language
* Phoenix
  - Classic MVC, very similar to Rails and Django (router, controller, model/domain, views & templating system)
  - Templating system with components
